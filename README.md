# Java-MapMaker

Map editor for the Adventure of Joe v2.

Fill in the map by select a tile to paint with and dragging across the screen. Add or remove rows, select layers for tiles to go on,
edit parts of the terrain to be impassable, and more. Export to a text file that can then be used to represent a game file in Adventure of Joe v2.
